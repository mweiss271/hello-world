##Repository Tutorial

###This is an attempt to add more to the README file and resolve the "Finish README" issue.

I'm attempting to learn about data science using R.  Currently, I'm studying through a Coursera class.  

LOCAL CHANGES: I would like to learn the following

* More about stats
* More about machine learning
* Data Science in general

See if I have to 'add' again.

Should be in dev branch
