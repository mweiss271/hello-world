Repository Tutorial

This is an attempt to add more to the README file and resolve the "Finish README" issue.

I'm attempting to learn about data science using R.  Currently, I'm studying through a Coursera class.  

LOCAL CHANGES: I would like to learn the following

1. More about stats
2. More about machine learning
3. Data Science in general

See if I have to 'add' again.

Should be in dev branch
